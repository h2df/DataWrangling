This project contains three parts:

**1. NZ Health Survey**

It demonstrates basic steps working with data: IO, filtering, reshaping, plotting, etc., by inspecting a national survey data on Kiwi's health condition.

**2. NZ Baby Names**

It demonstrates how EDA is done and more plotting skill by looking at the pattern of popular baby names in New Zealand.

**3. NZ Indicator**

This is a mini-report to demonstrate how a data-driven conclusion can be built up step by step.

Note that the data are not available for part 3.
