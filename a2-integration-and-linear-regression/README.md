This project focuses on creating a model to predict World Happiness Index. 

The process includes:

- integrating static data (file from the [WHI project](https://worldhappiness.report/)) and dynamic data (retrieved from the [World Bank Indicator](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator))
- cleaning, consolidating data
- EDA
- and finally, creating a linear regression model to fit the data

Stepwise feature selection is implemented for the model as an example.
