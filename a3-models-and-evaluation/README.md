This project is all about models. 

Based on the data from the [previous project](../a2-integration-and-linear-regression/), some simple classifiers (KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree) and clustering models (K-Means) are built. This is a more thorough demonstration of the process to tackle problem with models. The process includes:

- Objective clarifying
- Feature engineering
- Principal feature analysis
- Model selection and parameter tuning
- Cross-validation and model evaluation
- Conclusion report
